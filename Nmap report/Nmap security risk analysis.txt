NMAP POTENTIAL SECURITY RISK ANALYSIS:

	-PORT - 53/TCP 
	-SERVICE - DOMAIN 
	-SERVICE VERSION - dnsmasq 2.45

SCAN SUMMARY:
	* Nmap Scan perform: TCP SYS scan and services version detected.
	* total hosts scan: 256
	* Live Hosts: 2
	* Notable open port found: port 53/TCP on IP 10.81.197.93
	* Port 53 - Domain name system

SECURITY RISKS IN OBTAINED ANS:
	Oldest version of dnsmasq like 2.45 may have vulnerablties. Attackers may exploit these to:
	- Perform DNS cache poisoning
	- Execute remote code
	- Leak system information
	- If port 53 is exposed to the public internet, it increases the risk.

COMMAN OPEN PORT RISK ANALYSIS:
	 - Someone might get in without permission ( unauthorized access )
	 - You might be giving away info without realising it like ( sensitive data's )
	 - Old or Weak software might be running if a service on a open port hasn't update properly
it might be exposed easily by the attackers.
