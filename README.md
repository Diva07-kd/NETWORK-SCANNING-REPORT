# üîç Nmap TCP SYN Scan on Localhost

This repository contains the results and analysis of an `nmap` scan conducted on the localhost IP address. The primary objective of this scan is to identify open TCP ports using a **TCP SYN scan**, and assess potential security risks associated with the exposed services.

## ‚úÖ About the Project

**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is an open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing. This project focuses on scanning the localhost using the TCP SYN scan (`-sS`), which is known for being stealthy and effective in identifying open ports without establishing a full TCP connection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Operating System: Linux
- Nmap version 7.90 or higher recommended
sudo nmap -sS -T4 -Pn -v 127.0.0.1

  10.81.197.101	Target IP (localhost)

üîê Security Risk Analysis

Port	Service	Description	Potential Risk
22	SSH	Secure Shell login	Brute-force attacks if weak credentials; check for auth keys
80	HTTP	Web server	Unpatched web apps can be vulnerable to RCE, XSS, SQLi
631	IPP	Internet Printing Protocol	May leak printer info; rarely needed on production servers
5432	PostgreSQL	Database server	Open DB port can expose data; ensure password enforcement
5900	VNC	Virtual Network Computing	Vulnerable to MITM or brute-force; use encryption/tunneling
6379	Redis	In-memory DB, cache	Redis has no auth by default; should not be exposed
