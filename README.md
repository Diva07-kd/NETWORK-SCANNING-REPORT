# üîç Nmap TCP SYN Scan on Localhost

This repository contains the results and analysis of an `nmap` scan conducted on the localhost IP address. The primary objective of this scan is to identify open TCP ports using a **TCP SYN scan**, and assess potential security risks associated with the exposed services.

## ‚úÖ About the Project

**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is an open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing. This project focuses on scanning the localhost using the TCP SYN scan (`-sS`), which is known for being stealthy and effective in identifying open ports without establishing a full TCP connection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Operating System: Linux
- Nmap version 7.90 or higher recommended
sudo nmap -sS -T4 -Pn -v 10.81.197.101

  10.81.197.101	Target IP (localhost)

üîê Security Risk Analysis

Oldest version of dnsmasq like 2.45 may have vulnerablties. Attackers may exploit these to:
	- Perform DNS cache poisoning
	- Execute remote code
	- Leak system information
	- If port 53 is exposed to the public internet, it increases the risk.

COMMAN OPEN PORT RISK ANALYSIS:
	 - Someone might get in without permission ( unauthorized access )
	 - You might be giving away info without realising it like ( sensitive data's )
	 - Old or Weak software might be running if a service on a open port hasn't update properly
it might be exposed easily by the attackers
